## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Follow the coding standards

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Request review from maintainers

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode enabled
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` type usage
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Backend Standards

- Use Fastify decorators for request/response typing
- Implement proper error handling with custom error classes
- Use Zod for input validation
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Implement proper logging with structured logs

### Frontend Standards

- Use Vue 3 Composition API
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Use Pinia for state management
- Follow component naming conventions
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Security Standards

- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Use HTTPS in production

## Testing

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Security Tests**: Test for vulnerabilities and security issues

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm run test

# Backend tests only
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend tests only
cd frontend && npm test

# Security tests
npm run test:security
```

### Test Coverage

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
